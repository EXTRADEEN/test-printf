# _printf

_printf is a function to do formatted printing. In this program we develop the function for simple printing and the format specificatrions printing.

## Return value

Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

## Mandatory Tasks

0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life

Write a function that produces output according to a format.

- Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
- Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
- write output to stdout, the standard output stream
- format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need 
   to handle the following conversion specifiers:

- c
- s
- %

1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
    Handle the following conversion specifiers:

- d
- i

2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel

Create a man page for your function.

## Advanced Tasks

Add more specifiers
